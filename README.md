# Project Happy Thoughts API
This projects' aim was to create a personal backend for the Happy Thoughts project - a twitter like feed. 

## The problem
The previous API was public, so the goal was to create one where only the thoughts posted on this project would show up. 

Endpoints, 
* GET /thoughts to show all thoughts previously posted, in order of descending order. 
* POST /thoughts to be able to add new thoughts to the feed. 
* PATCH /thoughts/:thoughtId/like  to update the likes - now a unicorn! 

## View it live
This API is best viewed using a tool, like POSTMAN (https://www.postman.com)
